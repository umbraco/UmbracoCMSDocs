# UmbracoCMSDocs [WIP]

This is the new repository for articles and tutorials on Umbraco on .NET Core.

This is NOT the official documentation for Umbraco CMS. The official UmbracoDocs can be found on [github/UmbracoDocs](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs) or on [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/).

## Reading and using the articles

It is **important to note** that this entire repository is a work in progress (WIP), which means that it will not contain a completed section of the documentation for Umbraco.

All articles are divided into *topics* and each article can contain various *subtopics*. All topics and subtopics can be found under [Articles](Articles).

Each tutorial in the [Tutorials](Tutorials) folder has its own folder, in which multiple files and subfolders might also be found.

## Try out Umbraco on .NET Core

Umbraco on .NET Core is currently in alpha and everyone with an interest in Umbraco and the .NET Core framework is recommended to take it for a spin.

You can find instructions on how to get started with the product in the [Umbraco on .NET Core - Updates](UmbracoNetCoreUpdates.md) article.

We encourage any kind of contribution to this repository.

All files are written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). If you are new to Markdown make sure you learn the general as well as the [UmbracoDocs specific Markdown conventions](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Contribute/Markdown-Conventions/) before getting started.
